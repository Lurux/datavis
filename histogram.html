				<h3>The Visualization Shows:</h3>
				<p>This stacked area chart represents the main reasons why European students need to repair their smartphones over time.</p>
				<p>Each color in the chart corresponds to a different reason, and the x-axis indicates the age of the smartphones</p>

				<h3>The Visualization is For:</h3>
				<p>European students, educators, parents, and anyone interested in understanding smartphone usage patterns, providing insights into the factors influencing smartphone longevity and disposal habits among students.</p>

				<h3>The Visualization is important because:</h3>
				<p>Understanding these reasons is crucial because it sheds light on sustainability and environmental impact.</p>
				<p>By knowing why students discard or repair their phones, we can encourage better maintenance practices and advocate for longer-lasting devices.</p>
				<p>Additionally, manufacturers can use this data to improve phone durability and reduce electronic waste.</p>

				<h3>How to Read the Visualization:</h3>
				<p>Look at the x-axis to determine the age of the smartphones (ranging from 0 to 10 years).</p>
				<p>Observe the colored areas in the chart, each representing a specific issue (e.g., broken screen, water damage).</p>
				<p>The larger the area, the more prevalent that issue is among European students.</p>
				<p>Vertical lines indicate specific phone ages (e.g., 2 years, 4 years), providing additional context.</p>
