			<h2>Data source</h2>
			<p>These visualizations were created using data from <b>repair shop information</b>, so it may not be reflective of all the issues people can have with their smartphone.</p>
			<p class="separator">Instead, these visualizations give us an insight about the problems people have they may expect to be repairable.</p>

				<h3>The Visualization Shows:</h3>
				<p>The visualization depicts various reasons why European students might need to repair or dispose of their smartphones.</p>
				<p>Each reason is represented by a colored line extending from a central point, with the length of the line corresponding to the average age before experiencing specific issue.</p>
				<p>The most prominent issue, highlighted in red, is a “Broken Screen”, affecting approximately 58.7% of European students. The size of the circles is proportional to the percantage of affected students.</p>

				<h3>The Visualization is For:</h3>
				<p>This visualization is intended for European students, educators, parents, and smartphone manufacturers.</p>
				<p>Educators and parents can use this data to educate students about smartphone care and maintenance.</p>
				<p>Manufacturers can identify common issues and improve smartphone design and durability.</p>

				<h3>The Visualization is important because:</h3>
				<p>Reducing electronic waste: Understanding common smartphone issues can lead to better design and longer-lasting devices, reducing the need for frequent replacements.</p>
				<p>Financial savings: Repairing rather than replacing smartphones can save students money.</p>
				<p>Environmental impact: Proper disposal and repair practices contribute to sustainability.</p>

				<h3>How to Read the Visualization:</h3>
				<p>Look at each line extending from the central point. Each line represents a different issue leading to smartphone repair or disposal.</p>
				<p>The length of each line corresponds to the average age before experiencing specific issue. The size of the circles is proportional to the percantage of affected students.</p>
